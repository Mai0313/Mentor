      How to Use SubCircuit
      =======================
      This example shows how to use subcircuits.

      .. code-block:: py3



          import PySpice.Logging.Logging as Logging
          logger = Logging.setup_logging()


          from PySpice.Spice.Netlist import Circuit, SubCircuit, SubCircuitFactory
          from PySpice.Unit import *



      There is two ways to define subcircuit with PySpice, either using
      :class:`PySpice.Spice.Netlist.SubCircuit` or a simpler alternative
      :class:`PySpice.Spice.Netlist.SubCircuitFactory`.

      Let define a parallel resistor subcircuit using the :class:`PySpice.Spice.Netlist.SubCircuitFactory`

      .. code-block:: py3


          class ParallelResistor(SubCircuitFactory):
              __name__ = 'parallel_resistor'
              __nodes__ = ('n1', 'n2')
              def __init__(self, R1=1@u_Î©, R2=2@u_Î©):
                  super().__init__()
                  self.R(1, 'n1', 'n2', R1)
                  self.R(2, 'n1', 'n2', R2)


      Let define a circuit

      .. code-block:: py3


          circuit = Circuit('Test')


      then we can use this subcircuit like this

      .. code-block:: py3


          circuit.subcircuit(ParallelResistor(R2=3@u_Î©))
          circuit.X('1', 'parallel_resistor', 1, circuit.gnd)

          print(circuit)


      .. code-block:: none

          .title Test
          .subckt parallel_resistor n1 n2
          R1 n1 n2 1Ohm
          R2 n1 n2 3Ohm
          .ends parallel_resistor
          X1 1 0 parallel_resistor



      If the above way is not suited for your purpose we can use this second approach

      .. code-block:: py3


          class ParallelResistor2(SubCircuit):
              __nodes__ = ('n1', 'n2')
              def __init__(self, name, R1=1@u_Î©, R2=2@u_Î©):
                  SubCircuit.__init__(self, name, *self.__nodes__)
                  self.R(1, 'n1', 'n2', R1)
                  self.R(2, 'n1', 'n2', R2)

          circuit = Circuit('Test')
          circuit.subcircuit(ParallelResistor2('pr1', R2=2@u_Î©))
          circuit.X('1', 'pr1', 1, circuit.gnd)
          circuit.subcircuit(ParallelResistor2('pr2', R2=3@u_Î©))
          circuit.X('2', 'pr2', 1, circuit.gnd)

          print(circuit)


      .. code-block:: none

          .title Test
          .subckt pr1 n1 n2
          R1 n1 n2 1Ohm
          R2 n1 n2 2Ohm
          .ends pr1

          .subckt pr2 n1 n2
          R1 n1 n2 1Ohm
          R2 n1 n2 3Ohm
          .ends pr2
          X1 1 0 pr1
          X2 1 0 pr2
