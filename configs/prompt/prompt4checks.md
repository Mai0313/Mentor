```

### If the Circuit Type is not `Oscillator`, `Integrator`, `Differentiator`, `Adder`, `Subtractor`, `Schmitt`, or `BGR`, please follow the guidelines below to verify your circuit and ensure it meets the design requirements while avoiding common mistakes.

1. **Node Verification**:
   - **Input/Output Node Confirmation**: Ensure that all specified input and output nodes exist in your netlist. For example, if input node `Vin` and output node `Vout` are specified, please check whether they are correctly defined in the netlist.
   - **Consistency of Node Naming**: Check that the node names in the netlist match the required names exactly, avoiding case sensitivity issues or spelling errors.

2. **Operating Point (OP) Verification**:
   - **Voltage Source Settings**: Confirm that the voltage sources in the circuit (such as `Vdd`, `Vinp`, `Vinn`) are correctly set and comply with the circuit design requirements.
   - **Differential Input Voltages**: If the circuit is a differential design (e.g., a differential amplifier), ensure that the voltages of `Vinp` and `Vinn` are equal unless the design specifically requires a differential voltage.

3. **Component and Connection Verification**:
   - **Existence of Resistors**: In tasks that require a load resistor, check whether the netlist includes correctly connected resistor components.
   - **Miller Compensation Capacitor** (applicable to Task 9): Confirm that the Miller capacitor is correctly connected between the first stage output and the output node.
   - **Diode-Connected Load** (applicable to Task 10): Check whether the circuit includes a diode-connected load, such as by connecting the gate and drain of a MOSFET.
   - **Common Source/Gate/Drain Configurations**: According to the amplifier type, verify that the input and output nodes are connected to the correct terminals (Gate, Drain, Source) of the MOSFET. For example:
     - **Common-Gate Amplifier**: The input should be connected to the source, with the gate serving as the common node.
     - **Common-Drain Amplifier (Source Follower)**: The output should be taken from the source terminal.

4. **MOSFET Operating Region Verification**:
   - **NMOS Transistors**:
     - **V\_GS Verification**: Ensure the gate-source voltage `V_GS` is greater than the threshold voltage `V_TH` (`V_GS > V_TH`) to properly turn on the NMOS transistor.
     - **V\_DS Verification**: Confirm that the drain-source voltage `V_DS` is positive, and the drain voltage is higher than the source voltage (`V_D > V_S`).
     - **Connection Reasonableness**: Avoid connecting the drain of an NMOS transistor directly to ground.
   - **PMOS Transistors**:
     - **V\_SG Verification**: Ensure the source-gate voltage `V_SG` is greater than the threshold voltage `V_TH` (`V_SG > V_TH`), meaning the gate voltage is lower than the source voltage.
     - **V\_SD Verification**: Confirm that the source-drain voltage `V_SD` is positive, and the source voltage is higher than the drain voltage (`V_S > V_D`).
     - **Connection Reasonableness**: Avoid connecting the drain of a PMOS transistor directly to `Vdd`.

5. **Special Components and Configuration Verification**:
   - **Capacitor Connections**: Check that capacitor components are correctly connected, especially when compensation or AC bypass is required.
   - **Inductors and Other Components**: If the circuit involves inductors or other special components, ensure they meet the design requirements.

6. **Circuit Topology and Functionality Verification**:
   - **Overall Structure**: Confirm that the entire circuit structure aligns with the design objectives, avoiding unnecessary or missing components.
   - **Signal Path Check**: Verify the signal path to ensure the input signal can correctly influence the output.

7. **Simulation Setup and Result Verification**:
   - **Simulation Commands**: Ensure that you have used the correct SPICE simulation directives (e.g., `.OP`, `.DC`, `.AC`, `.TRAN`).
   - **Reasonableness of Results**: Run the simulation and check whether the results meet expectations, such as DC operating point voltages, current directions, gain, etc.
   - **Troubleshooting**: If simulation results are abnormal, check for issues like unconnected components, short circuits, or incorrect grounding.

8. **Model and Parameter Confirmation**:
   - **Component Models**: Verify that the component models used (such as `NMOS`, `PMOS`) are correct and that the model parameters meet the design requirements.
   - **Key Parameters**: Ensure that critical parameters like threshold voltage (`V_TH`), electron mobility, and others are reasonably set.

9. **File Format and Syntax Verification**:
   - **Netlist Syntax**: Ensure that the netlist syntax is correct, with no spelling errors, missing parameters, or incorrect node definitions.
   - **Line Formatting**: Check each line's format to ensure it complies with SPICE netlist syntax conventions.

10. **Suggestions and Corrections**:
    - **Addressing Issues**: If you find problems during the verification process, make adjustments based on the suggestions. For example, modify component parameters, reconnect nodes, or add necessary components.
    - **Re-simulation**: After making corrections, re-run the simulation to confirm that the issues have been resolved.

### If the Circuit Type is `CurrentMirror`, `Amplifier`, `Opamp` or `Inverter`, please follow the guidelines below to verify your circuit and ensure it meets the design requirements while avoiding common mistakes.

1. **Code Structure and Syntax:**
