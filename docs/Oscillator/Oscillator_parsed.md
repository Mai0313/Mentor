## **Design Goals**

| Supply |     | Oscillator Frequency |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| Vcc    | Vee | f                    |
| 5V     | 0V  | 1MHz                 |

#### **Design Description**

The oscillator circuit generates a square wave at a selected frequency. This is done by charging and discharging the capacitor, C1 through the resistor, R1. The oscillation frequency is determined by the RC time constant of R<sup>1</sup> and C1, and the threshold levels set by the resistor network of R2, R3, and R4. The maximum frequency of the oscillator is limited by the toggle rate of the comparator and the capacitance load at the output. This oscillator circuit is commonly used as a time reference or a supervisor clock source.

The image depicts an electronic circuit diagram featuring a TLV3201 operational amplifier (op-amp) configured as a comparator. Here is a detailed description of the components and their connections:

1. **Power Supply:**
   - The circuit is powered by a 5V DC supply (Vcc = 5V).
   - The positive terminal of the power supply (V+) is connected to the op-amp's positive power supply pin (+V).

2. **Resistors:**
   - **R2 (20kΩ)** and **R3 (20kΩ)** are connected in series between the positive power supply (V+) and ground. The junction of R2 and R3 provides a reference voltage.
   - **R4 (20kΩ)** is connected between the junction of R2 and R3 and the non-inverting input (+) of the op-amp.
   - **R1 (6.8kΩ)** is connected between the inverting input (-) of the op-amp and the output (Vo).

3. **Capacitor:**
   - **C1 (100pF)** is connected between the inverting input (-) of the op-amp and ground. This capacitor is likely used for noise filtering or stability.

4. **Op-Amp (TLV3201):**
   - The non-inverting input (+) of the op-amp is connected to the junction of R2, R3, and R4.
   - The inverting input (-) of the op-amp is connected to the junction of R1 and C1.
   - The output (Vo) of the op-amp is connected to the other end of R1 and serves as the output of the comparator circuit.

5. **Voltage Reference:**
   - The junction of R2 and R3 provides a reference voltage (Vref) to the non-inverting input of the op-amp. Given the equal values of R2 and R3, Vref will be half of the supply voltage (Vcc/2).

6. **Comparator Function:**
   - The op-amp is configured as a comparator. It compares the voltage at the inverting input (-) with the reference voltage at the non-inverting input (+).
   - When the voltage at the inverting input (-) is less than the reference voltage, the output (Vo) will be high.
   - When the voltage at the inverting input (-) is greater than the reference voltage, the output (Vo) will be low.

In summary, this circuit is a comparator using a TLV3201 op-amp, with a reference voltage set by a voltage divider (R2 and R3) and feedback provided by R1. The capacitor C1 is used for stability or noise filtering.
```

#### **Design Notes**

- 1. Comparator toggle rate and output capacitance are critical considerations when designing a high-speed oscillator.
- 2. Select C1 to be large enough to minimize the errors caused by stray capacitance.
- 3. If using a ceramic capacitor, select a COG or NPO type for best stability over temperature.
- 4. Select lower value resistors for the R2, R3, R4 resistor network to minimize the effects of stray capacitance.
- 5. Adjust R2, R3, and R4 to create a duty cycle other than 50%.

## **Design Steps**

1. When R2 = R3 = R4, the resistor network sets the oscillator trip points of the non-inverting input at one-third and two-thirds of the supply.

Here is the image describtion:

The image is a logo for Texas Instruments, a well-known technology company. The logo consists of several elements:

1. **Icon**: On the left side, there is a red icon that combines the letters "t" and "i" in a stylized manner. The "t" is positioned above the "i," and both letters are integrated into the shape of the state of Texas, which is also red.

2. **Text**: To the right of the icon, the words "TEXAS INSTRUMENTS" are written in black, uppercase letters. The font is bold and clear, making the company name easily readable.

3. **Website**: Below the company name, the website URL "www.ti.com" is written in black, lowercase letters. The font is smaller than the company name but still clear and legible.

The overall design is clean and professional, effectively representing the brand identity of Texas Instruments.
```

2. When the output is high, the upper trip point is set at two-thirds of the supply to bring the output back low.

$$\mathbf{V\_o = V\_s(\frac{\mathcal{R\_3}}{(\mathcal{R\_2} \| \mathcal{R\_4}) + \mathcal{R\_3}}) = \frac{2}{3}\mathbf{V\_s = 3.33\mathbf{V}}$$

3. When the output is low, the lower trip point is set at one-third of the supply to bring the output back high.

$$\mathbf{V\_o} = \mathbf{V\_s} \left( \frac{\mathbf{R\_3} \| \mathbf{R\_4}}{(\mathbf{R\_3} \| \mathbf{R\_4}) + \mathbf{R\_2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3} \mathbf{V\_s} = 1.67 \mathbf{V}$$

4. The timing of the oscillation is controlled by the charging and discharging rate of the capacitor C1 through the resistor R1. This capacitor sets the voltage of the inverting input of the comparator. Calculate the time to discharge the capacitor.

Vc = Vi e ‐ t R1C1 1.67 3.33 = e ‐ t R1C1 t = 0.69R1C1

5. Calculate the time to charge the capacitor.

$$\begin{aligned} \mathbf{V\_{i}} &= \mathbf{V\_{c}} \left( \mathbf{1} \text{-e}^{\frac{\mathbf{t}}{\mathbf{RC}}} \right) \\\\ \mathbf{1.67} &= 3.33 \left( \mathbf{1} \text{-e}^{\frac{\mathbf{t}}{\mathbf{RC}}} \right) \\\\ \frac{1.67}{3.33} &= \text{e}^{\frac{\mathbf{t}}{\mathbf{RC}}} \\\\ \mathbf{t} &= 0.69 \mathbf{R\_{1}C\_{1}} \end{aligned}$$

6. The time for the capacitor to charge or discharge is given by 0.69R1C1. With a target oscillator frequency of 1 MHz, the time to charge or discharge should be 500ns.

0.69R1C1 = 500ns

R1C1 = 724ns

7. Select C1 as 100pF and R1 as 6.8kΩ (the closest real world value).

# **Design Simulations**

### **Transient Simulation Results**

Here is the image describtion:
```
The image is a graph that plots two different waveforms over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0.00 to 5.00 seconds. The y-axis represents the output, ranging from 0.00 to 5.00 units.

There are two distinct waveforms shown on the graph:

1. **Green Waveform**: This waveform is a square wave. It alternates between a high value of 5.00 units and a low value of 0.00 units. The transitions between high and low values are very sharp, indicating an almost instantaneous change. The period of the square wave appears to be approximately 1 second, as it completes one full cycle (high to low and back to high) within this time frame.

2. **Red Waveform**: This waveform is a triangular wave. It starts at 0.00 units, rises linearly to a peak value of approximately 3.50 units, and then decreases linearly back to 0.00 units. This pattern repeats periodically. The period of the triangular wave is also approximately 1 second, matching the period of the square wave.

The two waveforms are synchronized in such a way that the peak of the triangular wave coincides with the midpoint of the high phase of the square wave. The triangular wave reaches its minimum value at the transitions of the square wave from high to low and from low to high.

The graph is likely used to illustrate the relationship between these two types of waveforms, possibly in the context of signal processing or electronic circuits.
